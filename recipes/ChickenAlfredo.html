        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the noodles: Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
                <li>Cook the chicken: Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. 
                    Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce</li>
                <li>Make the Alfredo sauce: Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and 
                    simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>
                <li>Assemble: Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. 
                    Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken.Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
