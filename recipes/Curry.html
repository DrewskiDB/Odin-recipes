    <h3> Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin (if there is any) from the chicken and cut it into small pieces. 
            Wash the chicken in water with the juice from the lime/lemon and the vinegar. 
            Drain away all the excess water from the chicken. Dry with kitchen towel if necessary.</li>
        <li>In a kitchen bowl, add the chicken, onion, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper, pimento berries, ginger, salt, all-purpose seasoning, 
            the curry powder and mix everything together and leave to marinate for 30 minutes or more.</li>
        <li>In a pot add the cooking oil and put to hot on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the seasoned chicken to the oil and stir well. 
            Let the chicken cook until lightly brown on all sides. Don't let the pot burn, add a tip of water if necessary.</li>
        <li>
            Stir in the carrot, potato and thyme. Add water enough to cover the chicken in the pot. Cover and leave to cook for 25-30 minutes,
